# VBA-challenge
Repository for my second homework: "The VBA of Wall Street"

**basic solution**
A Visual Basic file is included with the basic solution 
to the homework problems. With this script, a new table is 
displayed including the ticker, yearly change, percent
change and the total volume of the stocks. Cell formatting, 
for loops, conditionals and working with multiple worksheets
are some skills needed to the completion of this assignment.

**resource folder**
Contains the files used to test and run the macros.
